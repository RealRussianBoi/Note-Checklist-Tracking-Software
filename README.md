# Note & Checklist Tracking Software

This project is a modern, professional-grade refactor of my original note-taking software, rebuilt from the ground up as a full stack React + Node.js application.  
It supports saving and editing notes and checklists with persistent storage in an SQLite database, featuring a clean, responsive UI and advanced search capabilities.

## üìñ About This Project

The original artifact was my first attempt at building a React/Node.js application. Its purpose was to save notes and checklists into an SQLite database to help me learn full stack engineering.

For this enhanced version, I rebuilt the entire application into a complete, functional, and professional-grade full stack app.

### Key Improvements
- **Software Design & Engineering** ‚Äì Implemented a **component-based architecture** in React for scalability and maintainability. Added a responsive UI with:
  - Homepage
  - Note management page (create/edit)
  - Checklist dialog (add/edit checklist items)
- **Database Integration** ‚Äì Integrated a **SQLite** database with full CRUD operations for notes and checklists, ensuring real-time, persistent data storage.
- **Algorithms & Data Structures** ‚Äì Developed an **advanced search and ranking feature** using:
  - Custom relevance scoring algorithm
  - MaxHeap for organizing results so the most relevant appear first

This transformation showcases my ability to deliver high-quality, industry-standard full stack applications while applying database design and algorithmic problem-solving skills.
